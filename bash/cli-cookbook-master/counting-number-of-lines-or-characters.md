# Counting number of lines or characters

## Problem
We want to count the number of lines, characters or words in a file

## Solution
To count the number of characters, words or lines, we use `wc`

```
    # this shows number of line, words, character respectively
    wc <file>

    # show number of lines
    wc -l <file>

    # show number of words
    wc -w <file>

    # show number of characters
    wc -c <file>
```
