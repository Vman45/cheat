# Printing a file in text or hex

## Problem
We want to print a file with different representation. We also want to print various information related to the file.

## Solution
For text file we can use various command like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `more`, `less`

If we want to see file in hex format we can use `hexdump`

```
    hexdump <file>
```

To print information about the file such as file type we can use `file` command

```
    file <file>
```
